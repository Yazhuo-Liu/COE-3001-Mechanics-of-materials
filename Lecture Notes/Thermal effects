# Thermal Strain and Static Indeterminate Problems

## 1. Introduction to Thermal Strain (10 minutes)

### 1.1 Definition of Thermal Strain
- Thermal strain occurs when a material deforms due to temperature changes, without external forces acting on it.
- The thermal strain, \( \varepsilon \), is defined as:
  \[
  \varepsilon = \alpha \Delta T
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \alpha \) = Coefficient of thermal expansion (material property),
  - \( \Delta T \) = Change in temperature.

### 1.2 Relationship between Thermal Strain and Mechanical Strain
- Mechanical strain results from external forces, whereas thermal strain results from changes in temperature.
- Thermal strain can occur in the absence of any applied loads, making it an important consideration in structures exposed to temperature variations.

### 1.3 Isotropic vs. Anisotropic Materials
- **Isotropic materials**: Uniform thermal expansion in all directions (e.g., most metals).
- **Anisotropic materials**: Different expansions along different directions (e.g., crystals with non-cubic lattice structures).

### 1.4 Examples of Thermal Strain
- Bridges and railway tracks expand in summer and contract in winter.
- Thermostats use bimetallic strips that bend due to different thermal expansions.

## 2. Thermal Stress and Static Indeterminacy (15 minutes)

### 2.1 Thermal Stress in Constrained Structures
- When a material is prevented from expanding or contracting freely due to constraints, **thermal stress** develops.
- The thermal stress, \( \sigma \), in a constrained material can be expressed as:
  \[
  \sigma = E \alpha \Delta T
  \]
  Where:
  - \( E \) = Young's modulus (stiffness of the material),
  - \( \alpha \) = Coefficient of thermal expansion,
  - \( \Delta T \) = Change in temperature.

### 2.2 Statically Determinate vs. Statically Indeterminate Structures
- **Statically determinate structures**: The number of unknown forces equals the number of equilibrium equations (can be solved directly using equilibrium conditions).
- **Statically indeterminate structures**: More unknown forces than equilibrium equations (requires additional compatibility conditions to solve).
  
### 2.3 Thermal Stress in Statically Indeterminate Structures
- In statically indeterminate structures, thermal stress depends not only on the material properties and temperature change but also on the way the structure is constrained.
- Solving these problems requires compatibility conditions, along with equilibrium equations.

## 3. Solving Statically Indeterminate Problems (20 minutes)

### 3.1 Method of Superposition
- The **method of superposition** involves breaking a problem into simpler parts (e.g., free thermal expansion and constraints due to supports).
- **Steps**:
  1. **Calculate free expansion**: Determine how much the material would expand or contract if it were unconstrained.
  2. **Apply compatibility conditions**: Enforce constraints (e.g., zero displacement at fixed supports).
  3. **Superimpose**: Combine the thermal expansion with the mechanical constraints to solve for reactions and internal stresses.

### 3.2 Example: Clamped Bar Problem
- **Problem**: A bar of length \( L \), fixed at both ends, is subjected to a uniform temperature increase \( \Delta T \).
  
  **Step-by-step solution**:
  1. **Free expansion**: Calculate the change in length if the bar were free to expand:
     \[
     \Delta L = L \alpha \Delta T
     \]
  2. **Compatibility condition**: Since the bar is fixed at both ends, the total displacement at the ends must be zero.
  3. **Reaction forces and stress**: Solve for the reaction forces and the internal stress using equilibrium and compatibility equations:
     \[
     \sigma = E \alpha \Delta T
     \]

## 4. Worked Example Problems (30 minutes)

### Example 1: Single Bar Constrained at Both Ends

- **Problem**: A steel bar of length \( L \), fixed at both ends, is subjected to a temperature increase \( \Delta T \).
- **Solution**:
  1. Calculate the free thermal expansion:
     \[
     \Delta L = L \alpha \Delta T
     \]
  2. Apply the compatibility condition (displacement at the ends = 0).
  3. Using the relationship \( \sigma = E \alpha \Delta T \), calculate the thermal stress and reaction forces.

### Example 2: Composite Bar with Different Materials

- **Problem**: A composite bar consists of a steel section and an aluminum section connected in series, each subjected to the same temperature increase \( \Delta T \). The properties of the materials are different: steel (\( E_s \), \( \alpha_s \)) and aluminum (\( E_a \), \( \alpha_a \)).
  
- **Solution**:
  1. Calculate the thermal strain for each material:
     \[
     \varepsilon_s = \alpha_s \Delta T \quad \text{and} \quad \varepsilon_a = \alpha_a \Delta T
     \]
  2. Enforce the **compatibility condition**: The overall length change must be the same for both sections.
  3. Use equilibrium and compatibility to solve for the stresses in each material.

### Example 3: Two-Pin Supported Beam with Thermal Gradient

- **Problem**: A horizontal beam is supported at two ends (pinned support) and subjected to a non-uniform temperature gradient along its length. Calculate the reactions at the supports and internal stresses.
  
- **Solution**:
  1. Divide the beam into small segments, each with a temperature change \( \Delta T(x) \).
  2. Calculate the thermal strain for each segment using \( \varepsilon = \alpha \Delta T(x) \).
  3. Apply the **compatibility condition**: No net displacement at the supports.
  4. Solve for reaction forces and internal stress using superposition and equilibrium equations.

### 5.1 Thermal Strain in Bridges and Buildings
- Bridges expand and contract due to seasonal temperature changes. Engineers design expansion joints to allow for this movement.
  
### 5.2 Pipelines
- Long pipelines can experience significant thermal expansion. They are designed with bends and expansion loops to accommodate temperature changes and prevent failure.

### 5.3 Industrial Applications
- In precision engineering, components are often designed to minimize thermal expansion, or materials with low thermal expansion coefficients (like Invar) are used.

## 6. Summary (5 minutes)

- **Thermal Strain**: Deformation due to changes in temperature.
- **Thermal Stress**: Stress that develops in a material when thermal expansion is constrained.
- **Statically Indeterminate Structures**: Structures that cannot be solved using equilibrium equations alone; compatibility conditions must be considered.
- **Method of Superposition**: A technique to solve thermal stress problems by considering both free expansion and constraints.

### Key Formulas
- Thermal strain: \( \varepsilon = \alpha \Delta T \)
- Thermal stress: \( \sigma = E \alpha \Delta T \)

### Key Takeaways
- Thermal effects must be carefully considered in the design of structures to avoid failure.
- Statically indeterminate problems involving thermal strain require both equilibrium and compatibility conditions for a solution.
