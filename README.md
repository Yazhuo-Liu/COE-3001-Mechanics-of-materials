# Mechanics of materials Course Resources

## Author: Yazhuo Liu @ Georgia Institute of Technology

A Mechanics of Materials course typically covers the fundamental principles and concepts related to the behavior of materials under various loading conditions. This course is common in engineering programs, especially in civil, mechanical, aerospace, and materials engineering. This course introduces students to the fundamental principles governing the behavior of materials under the influence of external forces. Emphasis is placed on understanding how different materials respond to loads and the analysis of structural elements subjected to various types of stress and deformation. The primary objective is to provide students with a solid foundation in the mechanics of materials, enabling them to analyze and design structures and components in engineering applications.
